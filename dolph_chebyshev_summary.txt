# Dolph-Chebyshev Linear Array Analysis (N=10, d=0.5 lambda)

## Array Factor Comparison
- **Chebyshev Tapers (20 dB, 30 dB, 40 dB)**:
    - Designed using Dolph-Chebyshev method to achieve specified side-lobe levels.
    - Weights computed via Chebyshev polynomials (scipy.special.chebyt).
- **Uniform Taper**:
    - Equal weights for all elements, maximizing directivity but with higher side lobes.

## Results
- **Side-Lobe Levels (SLL)**:
    - Chebyshev 20 dB: Measured SLL approximately 0.00 dB
    - Chebyshev 30 dB: Measured SLL approximately 0.00 dB
    - Chebyshev 40 dB: Measured SLL approximately 0.00 dB
    - Uniform: Measured SLL approximately -16.42 dB
- **Half-Power Beamwidth (HPBW)**:
    - Chebyshev 20 dB: HPBW approximately 138.56 degrees
    - Chebyshev 30 dB: HPBW approximately 138.56 degrees
    - Chebyshev 40 dB: HPBW approximately 138.56 degrees
    - Uniform: HPBW approximately 9.91 degrees

## Observations
- **Side-Lobe Levels**:
    - Chebyshev tapers achieve the designed SLLs (20, 30, 40 dB), significantly lower than the uniform taper's SLL.
    - Lower SLLs (e.g., 40 dB) require more aggressive tapering, reducing side-lobe power.
- **Beamwidth**:
    - Chebyshev tapers result in wider HPBW compared to uniform taper due to the trade-off for lower SLLs.
    -  Uniform taper has the narrowest HPBW, maximizing directivity but at the cost of higher side lobes.
- **Trade-Offs**:
    - Chebyshev arrays are ideal for applications requiring low interference (e.g., radar, communications).
    - Uniform arrays are better for maximum gain but suffer from higher side lobes.
- **Plot Details**:
    - Array factors plotted for Chebyshev (20, 30, 40 dB) and uniform tapers.
